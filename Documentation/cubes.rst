Cubes Architecture
==================

A ``Cube`` is a logical entity, composed by a ``data plane`` (which can include one or more eBPF programs) and a ``control/management plane``.

In addition, a Cube may include also a ``slow path`` in case some additional data plane-related code is required to overcome some limitations of the eBPF data plane.
This is the case of flooding packets in an 802.1 bridge, when the MAC destination address does not exist (yet) in the filtering database.
In fact, this action (which requires a packet to be sent on all active ports except the one on which it was received) involves redirecting a packet on multiple interfaces, an operation that is not supported by the eBPF technology.
In addition, this operation may require a loop in the dataplane, i.e., cycling on the list of interfaces and send them the packet, which is hard to do due to the eBPF limitations.

Types of Cubes
--------------

Polycube has two diferent kind of cubes, **standard cubes** and **transparent cubes**.

Standard cubes have forwarding capabilities, such router and bridge.

A standard cube:
  - defines a :ref:`ports <cube-ports>` concept, ports are *connected* to other ports or netdevs;
  - makes a **forwarding** decision, i.e, sending the packet to another port;
  - it follows middle-box model, is a network function with multiple ports;

::

             standard cube
           +--------------+
           |              |
           | +----------+ |
   port1---|-|          |-|---port3
           | |   core   | |
   port2---|-|          |-|---port4
           | +----------+ |
           |              |
           +--------------+

A transparent cube is a cube without any forwarding capability, such as a network monitor, NAT and a firewall.

A transparent cube:
  - does not define any port, hence it cannot be *connected* to other services, but *attached* to an existing port;
  - it can be *attached* to an existing port such as the one of a normal service (e.g., port1 on router2) or a network device (netdev) in the host (e.g., `veth0` or `eth0`);
  - it *inherits* all the parameters associated to the port it is attached to (e.g., MAC/IPv4 addresses, link speed, etc.);
  - it allows to have a *stack* of transparent services on top of a port, very similar to a stack of functions.

A transparent cube can define two processing handlers, *ingress* and *egress*, which operate on two possible traffic directions:
  - *ingress*: it handles the traffic that goes *toward* the port it is attached to. In case of a netdev (e.g., `eth0`), this selects the traffic that comes from the external world and goes toward the TCP/IP stack of the host. In case of a cube port, it is the traffic that is *entering* in the network function.
  - *egress*: it handles the traffic that comes from the cube/netdev it is attached to. In case of a netdev (e.g., `eth0`), it selects the traffic that comes from the TCP/IP stack and *leaves* the host from that port. In case of a cube port, it is the traffic that is *leaving* the network function.

``polycubectl ?`` shows available cubes installed on your system.


A shadow cube:
  Only a standard cube can be **Shadow** type;
   - ``polycubectl <cubetype> add <cubename> shadow=true``.

  A shadow cube is associated with a Linux network namespace;

  The parameters between the shadow cube and the namespace are aligned;

  A port defined on a shadow cube is also visible from the network namespace:
   - the user can decide to configure the ports using Linux (e.g. ifconfig or the ip command) or polycubectl;

     for example: "``polycubectl <cubename> ports <PortName> set ip=<IpAddress>``" it is the same as "``ip netns exec pcn-<cubename> ifconfig <PortName> <IpAddress>``".
   - the developer can let Linux handle some traffic by sending it to the namespace (e.g. ARP, ICMP, but in general all those protocols able to be managed by a tool running inside the namespace);

Cubes structure
---------------

Cubes Instances
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Cubes are created by the ``polycubectl <cubetype> add <cubename>`` command, for example:
::

  # create a router instance called r1
  polycubectl router add r1
  # create a simplebridge instance br1
  polycubectl simplebridge add br1


.. _cube-ports:

Create Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Cubes can send/receive traffic through ``ports``.

NOTE: Just create a port does NOT allow to send/receive traffic.

Ports are created using ``polycubectl <cubename> ports add <portname> [parameter=value, [parameter1=value1, ...]]``.

In order to ``send/receive traffic``, the user has to setup the ``peer`` value or use the equivalent ``connect`` primitive. More details next.

Ports are logical entities and need to be connected to (physical/virtual) network interfaces or to other ports to be fully operational.

::


                 +----------+                                     +---------+
     port1 ------|    r1    |------ port2-----><-------port2------|   br1   |
    (netdev)     |  (cube)  |    (cube port)        (cube port)   |  (cube) |
    peer=veth1   +----------+  peer=br1:port2      peer=r1:port2  +---------+
                       |
                       |
                     port3
                    (netdev)
                   peer=eth0


For instance:
::

  # create port2 on br1 (simplebridge), it doesn't require any further parameters
  polycubectl br1 ports add port2

  # create portX on r1 (router), it doesn't require mandatory parameters, but it is useful to assign an ip (during or after creation)
  polycubectl r1 ports add port1 ip=10.0.1.1/24
  polycubectl r1 ports add port2 ip=10.0.2.1/24
  polycubectl r1 ports add port1 ip=10.0.3.1/24

Connect Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Two primitives are available: ``set peer`` or ``connect``.

Set peer
--------

The ``peer`` parameter defines where the port is connected to, it is possible to connect ports to linux netdevs or to ports belonging to other cubes.

- set peer to a ``netdev`` name in order to connect to it, (``eth0``, ``wlan0``, ``veth1``...)
- set peer to ``cube_name:port_name`` to connect the port to the port of another cube. (e.g. ``br1:port1``). In this case the peer on both ports have to be set in order to create the connection.

If the ``peer`` is empty it means the port is down, so packets are not received from it, and packets sent through it are dropped.

Following is an example, referred to previous picture.
::

  #using set peer
  polycubectl r1 ports port1 set peer=veth1
  polycubectl r1 ports port3 set peer=eth0
  polycubectl r1  ports port2 set peer=br1:port2
  polycubectl br1 ports port2 set peer=r1:port2

Connect
-------

The ``connect`` primitive provides an alternative way to connect ports.

- connect to a ``netdev`` - Use ``polycubectl connect <cube1>:<port1> <netdev>``
- connect to ``cube_name:port_name`` - Use ``polycubectl connect <cube1>:<port1> <cube_name>:<port_name>``


Following is an example, referred to previous picture.
::

  #using connect
  polycubectl connect r1:port1 veth1
  polycubectl connect r1:port3 eth0
  polycubectl connect r1:port2 br1:port2


Attach and Detach primitives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These primitives allow to associate transparent cubes to standard cube's ports or to netdevs on the system.

::

  polycubectl attach firewall1 r1:port2

  polycubectl attach firewall0 veth1


Span Mode
---------

The shadow cubes have a mode called **span**.

The span mode when activated shows all the traffic seen by the service also to the namespace.
 - To activate the span mode the command used is "``polycubectl <cubename> set span=true``".

Span mode is very useful for debugging; On a shadow cube in span mode programs such as Wireshark or Tcpdump can sniff the traffic.

However, the span mode consumes many resources when it is active, so it is disabled by default and it is recommended to use it only when necessary.

N.B. Span mode duplicates traffic so that it is shown by the namespace, the cube continues to handle traffic.
For this reason, for example, if we have a shadow router with active span mode we should not have Ip forwarding active on Linux, otherwise the router service forwards packets and copies them to the namespace, the namespace forwards again packets and there will be duplications.

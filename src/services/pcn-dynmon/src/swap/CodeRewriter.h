   *               alternatively.

   * Method to compile/optimize user injected code according to the parameter he has inserted.
   * Firstly, it is checked if there's the need of performing optimization.
   * If some map has been declared as swappable, then will be performed the following
   * optimization in cascade if some of them fails:
   * - Enhanced: a master pivoting code will control which program to call when new
   *            packets arrive; new parallel maps will be declared and for those which
   *            have not been declared swappable, a SHARED map will be used among the
   *            two programs.
   *            Read time: 5ms (index change) + time to read map
   * - Base:    two codes will be generated and they will alternatively be loaded into
   *            the probe. Every swappable map has a modified name in the second program,
   *            while the non-swappable will be shared thanks to program map stealing.
   *            Read time: 400ms (program reload) + time to read map
